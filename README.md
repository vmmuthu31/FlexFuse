## Prerequisites

Before using the sample app, ensure you have a **Kinto Wallet**.

Create an account by visiting [Kinto Onboarding](https://engen.kinto.xyz/onboarding).

## Installation

To get started with the sample app, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KintoXYZ/react-sdk-sample
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the project directory.

```bash
cd react-sdk-sample
```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use Yarn to install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
```

4. **Set up a local certificate**: Needed to run the app on https.

```bash
brew install mkcert
mkcert -install
mkcert dev.kinto.xyz localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

// You should see something like this
The certificate is at "./dev.kinto.xyz+3.pem" and the key at "./dev.kinto.xyz+3-key.pem" âœ…
```

5. **Set up a local DNS**: Change the `etc/hosts` file to run the app locally on dev.kinto.xyz.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts

// Add the following line and save the file
127.0.0.1       dev.kinto.xyz
```

6. **Start the Application**: Run the app using Yarn.

```bash
yarn start
```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can explore the features provided by the Kinto Wallet SDK. This sample app demonstrates how to connect to a Kinto wallet, send transactions, and manage wallet interactions.

### Using your application

1. **Developer Account**: Create a developer account, deploy a contract, and create the application. Use your main contract address as the app address. Visit [Kinto Developers](https://engen.kinto.xyz/developers) to get started.

2. **Set the App Address**: Ensure you have set the app address in `App.tsx` in the `counterAddress` variable and make sure the Kinto Wallet SDK is initialized with that address.
