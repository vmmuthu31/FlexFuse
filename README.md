## Introduction

FlexFuse is an innovative platform that simplifies decentralized finance (DeFi) interactions by providing seamless expense management and multi-chain subscription services. Built on the Kinto platform, FlexFuse leverages User-Owned KYC, Account Abstraction, and cross-chain interoperability to enable secure, non-custodial, and transparent transactions across various blockchains.

## Features

- **Multi-Chain Recurring Payments**: Subscribe to services using any token on any supported blockchain.
- **Transparent Expense Management**: Split bills, track expenses, and settle payments within groups.
- **User-Owned KYC**: Enhanced trust and compliance with decentralized KYC verification.
- **Gasless Transactions**: No need for users to hold native tokens for gas fees.
- **Customizable Payment Options**: Accepts a wide range of tokens and supports major blockchains.
- **Subscription Analytics**: Dashboards for users and providers to track spending and revenues.
- **Shared Wallet Subscriptions**: Groups can collectively subscribe to services using a shared wallet.
- **Developer Incentives**: Mining rewards for developers building on FlexFuse.

## How It Works

### Subscription Payments

- **FlexFuse** automatically converts and transfers payments to the service provider's preferred tokens and chains.
- **Service Providers** receive payments seamlessly without worrying about token or chain incompatibilities.

### Group Expense Management

- **Create Groups**: Users can form groups to manage shared expenses.
- **Add Expenses**: Expenses are added to a shared ledger with transparent tracking.
